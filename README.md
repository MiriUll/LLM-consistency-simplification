In this repository, you find the code for the paper [Simpler becomes Harder: Do LLMs Exhibit a Coherent Behavior on Simplified Corpora?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06838).

Unfortunately, due to license restrictions, we could not publish the datasets itself.
However, we published the code to recreate the model predictions and plots.
